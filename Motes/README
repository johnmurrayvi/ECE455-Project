This assumes ALL devices are TelosB motes.
The sampling period is 6 minutes (i.e. 10 samples an hour).

--- Compilation and Install ---

At least 1 mote needs to be a "GardenSensor".
To install the program to the desire mote, with n being a *unique* ID from 1-255 run:
    make telosb install,<n>

  ex:
    make telosb install,2
    ** unplug mote and plug in second one **
    make telosb install,3


Only 1 mote should be the "GBaseStation".
It should remain connected to the usb even after installing the program.
Generally, I would set the base station ID to 1, but it doesn't matter as long as they're all unique.
    make telosb install,<n>

  ex:
    make telosb install,1


--- Getting Data from the Base Station Mote ---

Once the sensor and base station motes are programmed, the packets sent from the sensor motes are received
by the base station and sent to the host via a serial connection.

To see the raw data, first determine the device location of base station.
This can be found using the "motelist" command. An example would be "/dev/ttyUSB0".

Then, the following command can be used to listen to incoming packets:
    java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@<device location>:<device>

  ex:
    java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb


--- Interpretting the Packet Data ---

The packet data observed is in a specific format.

The first 8 bytes are the header. Typically, they'll look something like this:
    00 FF FF 00 02 3E 22 99 
    Note: The 5th byte is the ID of the source mote and the 8th byte is the message ID (0x99 in this case).

The bytes after the header are the payload. It is currently 64 bytes and contains all of the sensors data.

The first 2 bytes (9th and 10th of the packet) of the payload are fixed (to aid in visual inspection). 
These bytes will be "FF FF".

The next 2 bytes (11th and 12th of the packet) of the payload are the number of samples. 
This is set to 10 currently, thus it should be "00 0A". 

Following this value is three arrays, where each value is 2 bytes and lengths are the number of samples.
For 10 samples, each array will be 2 * 10 = 20 bytes.
The data arrays are in this order: Light (PAR), Temperature, Humidity.

  ex: (of payload, packet header is not included)
    FF FF 00 0A 00 1B 00 1B 00 19 00 19 00 19 00 1C 00 1A 00 1A 00 1B 00 1A 1A 00 1A 02 1A 05 1A 06 
    1A 06 1A 05 1A 06 1A 06 1A 07 1A 06 05 66 05 61 05 5C 05 58 05 52 05 4C 05 48 05 44 05 40 05 3E

    This can be broken down into:
    FF FF                                                           Fixed Bytes
    00 0A                                                           Number of Samples
    00 1B 00 1B 00 19 00 19 00 19 00 1C 00 1A 00 1A 00 1B 00 1A     Light Sensor Data
    1A 00 1A 02 1A 05 1A 06 1A 06 1A 05 1A 06 1A 06 1A 07 1A 06     Temperature Sensor Data
    05 66 05 61 05 5C 05 58 05 52 05 4C 05 48 05 44 05 40 05 3E     Humidity Sensor Data

Again, the sampling interval is 6 minutes (i.e. 10 samples an hour).
